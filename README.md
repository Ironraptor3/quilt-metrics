# quilt-metrics

Contains code for calculating several metrics on images. Notes:
- The java code requires the [Vizhub Library](https://bitbucket.org/rmardiko/vizweb/src/master/) (and its dependencies) to run.
- The python was run in a slightly-modified Anaconda environment.
- The batch file may need to be adjusted to fit the exact path needs.
  - The batch file also requires the [MPEG7 Executable](http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~bilmdg/bilvideo-7/Software.html) to run properly
